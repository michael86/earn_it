                <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">
                    We wanted to create a simple system where everyday tasks turn into meaningful rewards.
                    Parents can clearly assign responsibilities, and children can see their progress build towards something they truly want.

                    Built for families
                </h3>
                <p class="mt-3 text-gray-600">
                    Earn It is built around the family unit. Each family has their own private space where tasks, points, and wish lists stay secure and separate.
                    No outside interference, no confusion.

                    Everything is designed to be clear and transparent. Tasks have defined rewards, progress is visible, and achievements feel earned.
                    It is about building trust as much as motivation.
